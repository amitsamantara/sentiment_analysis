In this repositry called "sentiment_analysis", I have made a program written in Python to read all the reviews from a particular site and make an accurate guess about 
the emotion/sentiment projected by that review.

For example - 

Review - I love your website for giving me heavy discount
Sentiment Caught - Positive, Happy

Review - I recived a defective product, worst website to shop on.
Sentiment Caught - Negative, Angry
